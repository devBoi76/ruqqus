Hey there, {{ user.username }}

Thanks for using Two-Factor Authentication to help secure your Ruqqus account.

We recently rolled out the ability to generate a **Two-Factor Recovery Code** when setting up Two-Factor Authentication. Because this provides a cryptographically secure method of recovering a Two-Factor account, **we will be removing the existing 24-hour wait recovery** before the end of the month.

Once that happens, **it will not be possible to recover a Two-Factor account without a Recovery Code.**

To obtain a Two-Factor Recovery Code, navigate to your account security settings, and remove and re-add Two Factor Authentication to your account.

Thanks for using Ruqqus!

-The Ruqqus team
